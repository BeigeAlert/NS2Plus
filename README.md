NS2+
==========

This Natural Selection 2 mod aims to improve, fix and expand the game in order to bring players a better experience. It contains extra customization options and quality of life improvements. This mod needs to be installed on the server.

To be able to search for servers running NS2+ you can use [NS2+ Browser](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=236685163). Remember to set it to Active in your Mods list.
